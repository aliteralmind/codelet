**Codelet**: Automated insertion of *already unit-tested* example code (its source code, console output, and input text-files) into JavaDoc using inline taglets--Codelet makes it possible to have *always accurate documentation*. As with all inline taglets, codelets are automatically processed when generating your JavaDoc. Customizations include: [-] Displaying only a portion of an example's source code (code snippets), and [-] Making the *first appearance* of a class, function, or object names into a clickable JavaDoc link.
